## ChatIO

This is a website which allows different users for interactive messaging. Here after invoking the website, the user has to enter a username to join the chat room for communicating with each other.
 All the usernames joined in the chatroom will be displayed in a box below the chat window.

When the user closes the browser, the particular user will be disconnected from the chatroom and will not get the messages sent be the other users after it.

To use this, first the developer has to install the dependencies by running the command:
>  npm install

After that, they can start using it by invoking the website in port no: 3000.

This ChatIO app is hosted in Heroku

_Issues to be fixed_

*   Ideally, no two same usernames should be accepted. But the issue is, if the usernames are with different cases, they are getting accepted which needs to be fixed.
